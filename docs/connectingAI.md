# How AI happened 

**28 sep 2019**

Funnily, if you ask almost anyone on this planet "What is AI? what is Artificial Intelligence?", most of them will have an accurate subjective answer, whether it's in actual technical truth, or as an abstract perspective. Some know one part, other's know other parts, and some others even might know both... Whichever part it is, everyone can apparently grasp a minimum understanding of what AI should be or is. 
The hows of why they might know it, or think that they do is through the influence of other people, like parents, friends or through entertainment stuff like TV, comics, the CypherPunks, books!...
And all of them seem to be true!

But however smart anyone is, it seems tricky to answer this very fundamental question about it.
"But how did it all start?"

 The ones explaining the physical and technical side of it, will sort of start by describing the origins of the internet, or perhaps of electricity. Or even one step further explaining some natural laws of physics and even a bit of quantum something something.
 Anyhow, so... "When is it? when is it that it all started?"... `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
The even more scientifically geeky ones would say, "well yea, that kind of thing, right when the Big Bang happened...or even further older than that!...ehem..." `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Okay, the next group of type of people (the more abstract/philosophically/stoned/hippie/spiritual kind of people) would say: "well, Plato first introduced the world to this " " concept and then this guy named John something the third borrowed his idea and passed it onto the next and the next generation of kids and finally after a few centuries later, yea, here we are. With the goddamn AI. You get it?
And other philosophers/abstract thinkers would argue that it was with this guy some earlier centuries before or after...

And so the discussion goes on and on. Neverending arguments againts the opponents perspective to when it actually fucking happened...

Truth is, I don't have a clue!

But one thing that I think that we can all agree is that it took more than just a few kids obsessed with some 60s Sci-Fi books created this concept of AI a few decades ago. Watching porn for the first time in this box with something called the laptop...In other words, it did not occur in this goddamn century! For sure waaaay before!

My point of all this text, if you haven't guessed by now, is not about what actually AI is or when it started (I don't f**ing know), but it is truly just about expressing my admiration, fascination, hallucination, ecstatic reaction... for whenever I think about how amazing is to sense that all of this time, the age of the World, somewhat, every single generation, century, decade, year, minute, second, milifriking second...it has all been actually living next to those things, creatures, bacteria, humans that actually affected and influenced for sure in the creation of the thing we now so call it “AI”. 

All of these things, had to come from somewhere, which means that thanks to those who gave birth to these smart asses were also crucial for the making of the creation of AI. 

And what about the ones who gave birth to these others? And so it is, and infinite chain of consciousness (or probably even unconscious) of living + non-living things influencing and being part of the creation of the timeline of the existence of AI.

In other words again, my friend, every freaking moment, no matter how silly and repetitive it sounds, it is simply true, that AI exists and will continue to exist due to the actual existence of you/me/us/this.

Question now is, what are we going to do with it?

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Love always, Ly.
