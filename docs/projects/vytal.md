## Ly at Vytal

_From May to late Dec 2023_

I joined the team as a react native developer. This was my last task and I had the chance to also take part on the design.  
I had the freedom to play around with different UI/UX, so long I respected the design system in place.  

## Stack

The design was done in **Figma** and the code is written in **Typescript on React Native**.
