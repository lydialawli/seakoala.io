Ly went to her first 10 days meditation retreat on February 2019. Near Barcelona.

#### Notes 

- Vipassana is a meditation technique that helps purify the mind through **accepting reality as it is**.
 
- When you start practicing it, you are considered to be in the **path of Dhamma**, the path of liberation / enlightenment/ purification.

- It is a technique discovered from the teachings of Buddha, yet it is not tied to a certain belief or religion. 

- The technique is done by **observing** all the flow of **sensations** that we constantly have throughout our bodies.

- The point is to **disassociate** ourselves from those sensations, no matter how gross or subtle they feel, or how good or bad ( which are associations already). 

- We tend to want more of those pleasant sensations, as well as avorting those we feel unconfortable with. S.N.Goenka defines it as **craving** versus **avortion**.

- The **associations** we make from the sensations are the **cause of our misery**, not the actual sensations themselves, as they are constantly appearing and dissapearing. In other words, **sensations** are **impermanent**, but the associations we make from them is what is kept deep inside of our subconscious, which is why it requires **deep focus** in order to be able to reach that root level. 


- You learn to **not react** to those sensations and to simply observe it **equanimously** (with the understanding of the law of nature, the **law of impermanence**). 

- Eventually, through consistent practice, you go **deeper into your subconscious mind**, which is said to be connected to our sensations experienced in our bodies. 

- By going deep into your subconscious, you are able to find the root of the problems, the sufferings, the **suppressed emotions** that were never processed correctly, and then you will be able to observe it (with equanimity) and release yourself from it. 

- But before going deeper and deeper into our minds, one must learn to first stop creating the so called ***Sanharas*** (associations), if you keep generating more *Sanharas*, you will have to release from them before being able to go to a deeper level.

- It is not to enter or follow a religion, though many different religious people practice it.

- It is not sectarian. In fact, it's **universal**. 
IE. The technique does not teach you to follow any specific god or belief, it releases you from it.

- Discovered by the famous Buddha, or more precisely, by **Gautama** the Buddha. Yet, you don't need to be a Buddhist nor a monk or a nun to practice Vipassana and benefit from it.

- The main goal is to help you live in peace and harmony within yourself, independent from the exterior, which is out of our own control.

- All you need to start with this technique is some basic logistic (like a chal and a pillow), and a clear quite mind. It is recommended to focus on your breath (Anapana technique) if your mind keeps wondering around too much. 

- If you're mind is **wondering** around with one or more thoughts, do not worry, it is **normal**. The point of vipassana is not to eliminate such thoughts, but to **acknowledge** them and then refocus on what you want, say your breathing.
