# __UP TO YOU__ - My very first mobile app

*April 2018*

![uptoYouHeader](../projects/assets/up2U-header.png )

Built and released a React Native application to Play Store within 30 days.

Picked a fairly simple product: a coin and a dice app, provides a random an answer after pressing one of them.

~~Go to [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eth.uniworld.UpToYou) and download it for free!~~

**UPDATE November 2019** ==> the app has been removed from Playstore just recently. I still need to figure out this issue.

## Context

I was a **beginner** in the world of programming. All I had done before starting this project was some online courses:

- [Codecademy - _learn Javascript_](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)
- [Codecademy -_learn ReactJS_](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101)  
- [Codewars -](https://www.codewars.com/) _train coding skills with small katas/exercices_

I had the need to apply the newly gained knowledge into something more meaningful. Also to help boost my confidence up a bit, because well, this world of programming is a bit very intimating...

## Preparations and notes to myself

- Setup a working space physically and virtually (Visual Studio Code, github repository, nice clean desk...)
- Build an app that provides some value and launch it in a marketplace
- Read Google Play Store requirements in their [documentation](https://developer.android.com/distribute/best-practices/launch/launch-checklist)
- Stay [__lean__](http://theleanstartup.com/principles), don't overcomplicate things
- __No errors__ in the code before calling it a day
- Setup a __deadline__

## Tools I used

- macbook Air 2011
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (where I write my code)
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- [Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
- [React-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) (framework for building native mobile apps with javascript)
- [Vectr](https://vectr.com/) (free online vector software. I used it to design the coin and the dice)
- [Gifmaker.me](https://gifmaker.me/) to animate both [assets](docs/art/ilustrations-2018?id=a-coin-amp-dice-for-up-to-you-mobile-app)
- [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
- A nice desk and a yoga ball

## Conclusion

Totally worth it, but very painful at times.

I spent most of my time researching on how to do stuff, more than coding itself.
I felt grateful to actually find most of the solutions to my problems out there.

I originally had a very ambitious idea for this app, but as I was working on it, I realised that I had to make something simple and functional first, before adding secondary features.

One month later.. tadah! Mission accomplished, happy me. 🎉

I want to work on a newer version of it, as it has a few things to improve for sure.
But currently working on [Evok](https://github.com/lydialawli/Evok), my next mobile app after Up To You :)
