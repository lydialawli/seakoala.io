# The Gambia

Feb 2019

---

## Introduction

First time travelling to this country. Spent 7 days there. 
Kept a little notebook so Ly could write down all the curious and strange things that she notices about this foreign land. 

## Pre travel preparation

- Had to book a doctor‚Äôs appointment to get vaccinated for the [Yellow Fever](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/yellow-fever). </br>
(Since recently, a single dose provides a **life-long** protection against the disease. Yay!)
- Bought **Malaria Pills**, assigned by the doctor. Was recommended to take it a week before arrival to The Gambia.
- No need for VISA if you are European (things could change though)

## Good to know

- Locals call The Gambia simply by ‚ÄúThe River‚Äù. 
- Banjul is the capital city, but Serekunda is the largest urban center.
- Smallest country in mainland Africa. Also it‚Äôs literally inside Senegal, which is another country.
- Farming, fishing and tourism is what their economy is based on.
- Used to be part of British Colony so **English** is actually the official language of the country. Other main languages are **Mandinka**, **Fula** and **Wolof** (similar to Senegal, though Senegal was taken by French Colony). 
Some minority also speak **French**.
- Currency: **Gambian Dalasis** (1‚Ç¨ = 56.5 GMD ~)
- Religion: **95% Islam** and 4% Christianism
- Cuisine: must try Yassa and **Domoda** (peanut stew, Ly‚Äôs favourite! üòã). </br>
 Main used ingredients are: peanuts, rice, fish, meat, onions, tomatoes, cassava and chilli peppers. Abundance of chicken but of course, no pork (no haram meat).
- Transport: **Green taxi** (tourist, private, insured, fixed charges, price posted on boards usually)  and **Standard Yellow taxi** (what locals use, cheapest method, can be tricky if you are disoriented person like Ly, better study the map a little bit, costs **8 Dalasis per area**, say if you travel to 2 different areas on the same trip, you pay 8 Dalasis, twice ). </br>
There are other types of transport, check out this [web](http://www.accessgambia.com/information/taxis.html) for more info.
- They drive on the right side of the road.
- Weather: it's a sub-tropical country, so it's **summery** all year long between 29¬∞C and 34¬∞C. 
    **Rainy seasons** are July until September. Mosquitos are abundant then.
- Gambians are very **peaceful and friendly humans**. They seem to **avoid rushing** and getting into trouble.

## Notes

### Day 1

- Arrived to Banjul Airport at night time.
- Bargaining seems to be as natural as a greeting.
- The security scan incredibly fast and kind of felt pointless.
- At this small airport; those without a flight ticket are denied entrance to the building.
- Road was different than in Europe, asphalted but with many bumps, no traffic lights, or not respected anyway.
- Many cars in the country are 4x4. Yellow taxis seems to generally be Mercedes Benzs.
- Badala Park Hotel is decent, not too far from the center. Staff were very friendly and welcoming. Got invited to a reggae event which happens on Friday‚Äôs nearby.
- Night is chilly but very delightful.

### Day 2

- **Running by the beach** early morning felt amazing.
- Though the water was fairly warm to me, some Gambians seem to dislike the ‚Äúchilly‚Äù water.
- **Pololi Beach** is a long beautiful beach to enjoy tranquility and feel the peaceful vibes in this country. One tourist attraction there is **renting a horse for a ride** by the coast.
- **Monkey Park** was a little unexpected as I would have imagined to see more monkeys but saw more humans instead. Entrance fee was 150 Dalasis/tourist (50 for locals).
Saw only the monkeys I saw at the hotel. Gave them peanuts. Other type of monkeys were hidden apparently.
- I decided to skip the **Crocodile place**
- Was invited to hang out at a friends place. It was definitely the highlight of the day.
Big families lives next to each other sharing common space in the middle.
Woman in the family is usually the one in charge of cooking, not surprising I guess.
They spend a lot of time conversing and peeling peanuts for preparation for the famous tasty **peanut sauce**.
- The experience of **cooking a gambian meal** in this country was so special, and in a way, felt primitive. I read that you can book online for some cooking classes. But making friends with gambians isn‚Äôt really hard ;)
- **Markets** are common meeting points and is a cool spot to view the common gambian lifestyle. 
Supermarkets looked fairly the same as the ones in Europe.
- If the gambian clothing does not appeal nor fit you, it‚Äôs very common to go to **fabric shops** to fix it or even buy fabric to make your own designs.
- **Taking a taxi** was quite an adventure on its own. Had to take 3 taxis to make it back to the hotel. It was roughly 5km distance.
(They pay by zones. When you cross another zone you must pay 8 Dalasis again)
- Traffic was a bit chaotic but definitely much less than Manila.
- At Badala Park Hotel, night shows often happen to entertain clients, around 8:30pm. I saw some people dressed in traditional clothes and danced while others played some instruments.
