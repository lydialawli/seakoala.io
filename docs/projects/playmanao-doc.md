_Oct 2019_

__Play Manao app__ helps to make discovering a city/town a more interactive, challenging  yet fun activity to join and play. Both individually or collectively with friends and family, and perhaps even with strangers.

Whether you know the area or not, you would still be challenged by this game.

## So, how does it work?

There is a growing list of games in the app, pick the one you like and play!

Each __game__ is designed to be played in a specific place in the world.

Games are __free__ for everyone.  

The only requisit is that you must **locate yourself in the right spot** to start the game.  
Basically, if you were in Hong Kong; you wouldn't be able to play a game in Barcelona. **Geolocation** of the player is tracked for this matter, also to provide a more enriching user experience.

### Play a game

The __starting point__ of each game is provided. Locating yourself there will allow you to start playing.

Games are divided into __paths__. Each path contains a __problem__ which you need to __solve in order to unlock__ the doors to the next path.

Problem are like __quizzes__; challenges which you need to figure out using all your senses and observing your surroundings carefully. It may ask you to count, solve a puzzle, or to look around and ask locals... who knows?

A __clue__ is allowed in each quiz. Using it will reduce the points you gain from the quiz.

If the user is way too stuck, a solution will appear. No points will be gained at this quiz.

When all the paths are opened, you end the game. The your __final score__ will be shown to you.

Your score will added in the world __leaderboard__!

## Create a game

This is a key feature of Play Manao yet it is still under development.

The idea is there will be the ability to create one's own game. The platform would provide some easy and intuitive set of tools to make it happen. Like making a form, same same but different :)

Be a **player** or a **creator**. Join the community by making your own game or sharing the ones you like to play!
