## What does this do?

This is a new feature incorporated in one of the main screens in the Vytal app.
It lets the user report a problem regarding the store they interact with.

## Design process

Style wise; there was already an existing design system in place so there wasn't much for me to do there.
In fact, it was very helpful to have that ready so that it allowed me to dive into UX right away.  

My task was to understand what the requirement was, come up with the possible report types and design the process to be as easy and straight forward for the user as possible.  
Things like "should I use a modal or an entire screen?" was asked.  

All in all, despite being a small task, I still enjoyed the challenge and being able to shape this feature with advice from other teammates.

## Ly at Vytal

_From May to late Dec 2023_

I joined the team as a **react native developer**. This was my last task and I had the chance to also take part on the **design**.  
I had the freedom to play around with different UI/UX, so long I respected the design system in place.  

## Stack

The design was done in **Figma** and the code is written in **Typescript on React Native**.
