## Context

Built by two young developers (me and Monica) as their final project to graduate from a coding bootcamp.

Having 3 weeks to come up with an MVP, Play Manao was developed quite rapidly with two final games ready to be played, both within the island of Samui, Thailand (since the school was located there).

Since we are both based in Catalunya, we will first target users in Barcelona and all this northern area, creatng games based on this locations.

## Vision

A **social and global community** where the users themselves enrich the platform by creating games and/or playing and sharing them.  

**Connect enthusiasts and travel lovers** from all over the world through their achievements, shown in a global leaderboard.

Satisfying the human needs for **accomplishment and growth**, by provoking curiosity through challenging problems, building new experiences, and obtaining rewards for their efforts.

Creating a space for **collaborations/teamwork** and challenging rivals through a multiplayer experience.

A positive sum game for both the creators of the games and the local communities, by collaborating with local public services and supporting each other in return.
