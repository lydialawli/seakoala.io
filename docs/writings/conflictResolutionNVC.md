# Conflict resolution through NVC

30 March 2020

NVC stands for **Non Violent Communication**, developed by [Marshall Rosenberg](https://www.cnvc.org/learn-nvc/what-is-nvc) to bring a set of **tools/way of thinking/way of living** to enable honest and meaningful connections between humans.

This is an attempt to summarize the complex technique/philosophy of NVC and to contextualise it in a way that we can learn and apply it in our daily lives. Specially to **solve conflicts between our relationships**.

NVC is not only helpful to communicate clearly what you want but to also enable you to **develop empathy** and a **deep and true understanding** of your own needs and of others.

Here's a [list of needs and feelings](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/pdf_files/feelings_needs.pdf). I personally find it very useful to have this list around me in case I struggle to understand and find the right words to describe my current state.

### My dream would be to help you see and acknowledge:

- That **needs** are the **same for everyone** and that is **our own responsibility** to fulfill them.

- The **strategies** to fulfill the need are what **varies** between humans.

- You can request and propose a way for someone else to help fulfill your need, but never demand.

- Asking for a **clear and specific request** makes it easier for the other to help fulfill your need.
  
- **Everyone** is working on **fulfilling their own needs** so you cannot expect that others will always be there for you.

- Even if someone else is an asshole, they are the ones paying for it, not you. Don't get defensive and judgemental. The only way to have less assholes in this world is to **start empathising and listening** to them, and helping them see the world differently, through words and/or **through example**.

- Every individual has its preferred form of showing gracefulness and appreciation. If others do not show the same way you do, it **does not mean that they value you less**.

- Let everyone be however they want to be; there is **no point in judging or evaluating someone** if you trully want to understand them.
  
- We are all in **constant change** (continuous new experiences, new challenges, new ideas, new learnings, insecurities, new hobbies, evolving physical body...) and what NVC proposes is to view ourselves differently than the common way of *“I am (x)”* or *“you are (y)”*, but rather in the approach of *“I do this”* or *“you do that”*, to enable **more precision and truth and less confusion**.    
Same applies to when defining oneself; there is a difference between *“I am a climber”* and *“I climb. 3 times per week precisely”.*    
The first one can lead to **interpretations** of all sorts, while the other is just a fact an **no one can really deny that**. Hence, it is **less prone** to receiving **judgements** and **evaluations** from others.    
In other words, to **describe someone** using the **action itself** instead of **"to be"**.    

  ✖️ *“I am a dancer, but not a professional one”.*      
  ✔️ *“I dance often, I love it”.*     
  ✖️ *“You are a looser”.*      
  ✔️ *“You did not achieve the task on time”.*    
  
- Noone is *good/bad*, *right/wrong* or *better/worse* in NVC.
  
- The more you work on **understanding your needs**, the easier and **better** you can **treat yourself**. And the less you depend on others to be happy. *Practicing self-love = love yourself more = satisfied with yourself*

- NVC is not just a communication method but a way of thinking and living that will enable you to **more honesty with yourself and with others**.

## Conflict resolution

Imagine now that you are standing and facing towards **someone you love**. You now are dealing with a conflict with that person, you feel some level of **discomfort, neglect or perhaps distance**.

It may cross your mind that **there is certainly something** that the other person ***can do*** or ***can stop doing*** that you know it will make you feel better. You may know it, or you may not. Whichever case it is, those are the **strategies** to fullfill your need.

Before someone can agree to your strategy, they must first be able to understand you and also understand themselves and if they are capable of helping you or not in that situation.   
*Say that the other person has had a long shitty day from work and now has a great need for resting and peace. In that case, it is very hard and tiring for the other person to help you as they don't have the energy for it.*

So before jumping directly into "resolving" the conflict in your prefered way, make sure that you are both in the same page so that it allows the other to **help you out of compassion and empathy**, rather than by **force, obligation or fear**.

- Start by **understanding yourself** and what your **unfulfilled need** is (if you don't know it, how can others know?).   
  You may start by **feeling** it, it often helps.   
  Once you have it more or less clear you can [**describe your state and emotions**](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/pdf_files/feelings_needs.pdf) to the other person.  
  ✔️ *“I am feeling anxious and confused”.*  
  ✔️ *“I have a need for peace in my mind as I have been feeling anxious lately”.*   
  ✔️ *“I feel confused about your words so I have a need for some clarity”.*    
  ✖️ *“I'm angry because you ignored me”.*    
  ✔️ *“I feel sad and lonely because I have an unfulfilled need for support and connection”.*    
- After you articulated those words; the other person can **relate to those feelings and needs** (because we all have them), therefor the other person can finally **understand you**. Then, they most likely will try and help, as we are all loving creatures at the end of the day.    
But if that person is itself in a negative state, perhaps let that person also **work on their own needs** first.   

- Notice that we have not come up with a "solution" yet. Nor we have looked for anyone to blame.   
  For **long lasting relationships;** games of finding "who's the winner/looser" or "who's fault is it" are completely unnecessary, and most likely counterproductive. It would only **distant each other more**.

- If an **action of the other person**, whether past or present, is causing you some negative feelings; you can try to explain it as an **observation**, rather than a form of **judgement** or **evaluation**.    
Ie:   
  ✖️ *“When you visit your friends you are not responsible”.*   
  ✔️ *“I feel worried when I see you standing 1 feet close to your friends”.*  
That way you can **prevent** the other person from getting defensive and/or hurt from **feeling attacked**.

- Try making **positive requests** even if your current feelings are negative. Ie:    
  ✖️ *“Please stop talking”.*   
  ✔️ *“I'd like to have silence for a bit to help me focus on my meditation/work/rest”.*   
- You can even **be more specific** with your request (for how long, how often, when...). The more specific, the clearer it is for the other, and thus, the faster they can accept or reject your request.
- And again, if one **rejects your requests**; whether or not they reason it, your needs are still yours to be responsible for. **Anger and blame** won't help in this circumstances. Perhaps empathy and compassion will do.
- Once you stated clearly your feelings and needs, and the other person can empathise with you, most likely:
  - you'll already feel much better
  - you and/or together with the other person can come up with a solution to fullfill your need
