## What does Play Manao do?

Provides a growing list of **interactive games in the real world** for everyone to join and play.

More detailed explanation [here](/docs/projects/playmanao-doc.md).

## Context

Built by two young developers (me and Monica) as their final project to graduate from a coding bootcamp.

Having 3 weeks to come up with an MVP, Play Manao was developed quite rapidly with two final games ready to be played, both within the island of Samui, Thailand (since the school was located there).

Since we are both based in Catalunya, we will first target users in Barcelona and all this northern area, creating games based on this locations.

## App features/screens

- Signup/login screen
- Onboarding screen
- Profile screen: user can see all the games they've played, the points they've gained so far and where they can edit their personal info.
- Main screen: a list of all existing games as cards and a filtering section
- Game Detail screen: information about each specific game (tags, description, price, duration, length...) and the ability to start the game from here.
- Game Play screen: the game screen itself which is build by a series of steps/questions that the user resolves to unlock to the next step, up until the game is finished.

## Design process

The initial image served as the basis for the MVP creation process.  
With a focus on modern and playful design, I drew upon inspiration from video games to achieve the desired aesthetic. 

Crafting features such as signup/login, onboarding, and the main page presented little challenge.   
However, the Game Play screen proved to be more difficult as there were no comparable apps to draw from. 

Given the limited timeline, we opted for a simplistic design that would make both development and app usage easier.   
Each challenge involved answering a question, followed by a hint modal, input field, validation component, and a button to progress to the next stage.

## What does the name mean?

**Manao** means "lime" in Thai and we were inspired by the lime trucks that were advertised daily next to our coding school.
As the first (and ever build) game was based in the island we were in, we decided to embrace that name as it sounded appealing.

## Vision

A **social and global community** where the users themselves enrich the platform by creating games and/or playing and sharing them.  

**Connect enthusiasts and travel lovers** from all over the world through their achievements, shown in a global leaderboard.

Satisfying the human needs for **accomplishment and growth**, by provoking curiosity through challenging problems, building new experiences, and obtaining rewards for their efforts.

Creating a space for **collaborations/teamwork** and challenging rivals through a multiplayer experience.

A positive sum game for both the creators of the games and the local communities, by collaborating with local public services and supporting each other in return.
