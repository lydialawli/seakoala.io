## Introduction

Around 2016, Ly was first introduced to the idea of running and walking with "minimal shoes", or even barefoot. </br>
The idea of it sounded cool but it wasn't internalised in her enough to switch from "normal" shoes to those primitive-funny-looking soles.üòù

She then read [_Born to Run_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_Run:_A_Hidden_Tribe,_Superathletes,_and_the_Greatest_Race_the_World_Has_Never_Seen), by Christofer McDougall, and got super motivated to give it a try. Since then, it has become her preference pair of shoes for her daily life (for walking and also trail running).

## Which ones to get?

There are many brands nowadays that aim to replicate barefoot walking with their designs and materials. One successful brand is the [Vibram Five Fingers](https://eu.vibram.com/en/shop/fivefingers/). 

Ly got herself one of those in 2017 and she is pretty happy about them. 
**Lasts long** (but of course it's relative to how much you use it), **protects** you from tough conditions and it allows you to **maintain the barefoot walking mechanism**.</br>
In general, Ly prefers her hand-made sandals as it **feels like you‚Äôre not wearing anything** even though you have strong layer of protection.

(The points below are mainly to describe Ly's experience wearing hand-made shoes, but can be applicable to vibrams too)

### Benefits

- can run longer distances without hurting the knee
- body goes back to walking "naturally" and "properly"
- doesn't constrict your feet
- feet gets eventually stronger and confortable with different terrains
- more body awareness
- affordable
- fast to wear
- Let's your feet breathe so it doesn't get stinky 
- storing them is easy as they occupy close to nothing

### Challenges

- must be extra careful with the steps
- may get damaged or in need of fixes every now and then
- cannot run as fast and "jumpy" as when using classic sport shoes
- does not protect you from the cold, so extra (five finger) socks can help a lot
- in rainy days, it can be extra challenging to walk on them, though it dries fast
- might get a lot of stares (which well, so what ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

## Making your own minimal shoes

### Preparation

There are so many cool tutorials out there that shows how to DIY your own shoes with very basic materials. </br>
Ly's partner discovered this version (image) below which consists of a good piece of leather and a decent lace. Nothing you can't get easily. 

### Setup

Once acquired all the necessary tools and material, the **average time** to set this up (from scratch) is approximately **20-30 minutes**.   </br>
Logically, the more you practice, the faster it gets.

The image below is Ly's attempt to simplify the **steps in a visual way**. </br>
There are quite a lot of video tutorials out there too. So many options and styles. Gotta test them out to know what fits you best. </br>
Check out [Xero Shoes](https://xeroshoes.com/sandals/), they're like the bible for minimalist footwear üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Maintenance

The part that tends to break faster is the **lace** from the bottom part of the big toe, as it‚Äôs facing the ground. </br>
When it breaks, simply untie the knots and pull the string further to the toe and redo the 8 knot.
No need to remove the lace from the three holes.
