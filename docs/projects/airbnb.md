# Airbnb replica

_7 Nov 2019_

Link to the my [Airbnb replica website](https://airbnb-ly.herokuapp.com/) to play around. The code is on github, divided into [front-end](https://github.com/lydialawli/airbnb-react/) and the[ api](https://github.com/lydialawli/airbnb-api).

## Context

I attended a 2 month Fullstack development bootcamp this summer in Thailand.  
In the course, there were constantly new technologies and tools introduced to us, the students. In order to apply all this tools in a real scenario we build the replica of the Airbnb platform. Each of us worked on our own version of it.

The goal of this project was to learn how to build the front-end and the back-end, how to connect both ends together, practice and improve our Javascript level, and also to learm how to use external api's and frameworks.

## Stack

- **Javascript** everywhere
- **NodeJS** and **npm**
  
### Front-end

- **React** Framework
- **axios** for requests to the API

### Back-end

- **Express JS** to create a server
- **Mongodb** for local database
- **Bcrypt** for ensuring security with encryption
- **Postman** to test the server
- **Jws** to sign and manipulate tokens
- **Cloudify** cloud server for storing image files
- **mLab** cloud database
- **robo3t** a database interface
- **ngrok** to share localhost in different devices to test the app
