# Why Seakoala? 
Ly is short for Lydia. 
It's pronounced "Lee". Close friends and family call her Ly. 

Seakoala is some joke that started together with her partner. 
They discuss often about what a perfect world would look like in their eyes. One certain thing is that there would be amazing colors everywhere. They call it "Uniworld". 

And what's up with Seakoala 🐨? Well, Ly loves water, and being immersed in it, anyone who knows her enough definitely is aware of it. And koala is because she like hugs and cuddles, who doesn't? 

Ah, and she is a professional sleeper too 🤤
