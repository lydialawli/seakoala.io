## Ly at Vytal

_From May to late Dec 2023_

I joined the team as a **react native developer**. This was my last task and I had the chance to also take part on the **design**.  
I had the freedom to play around with different UI/UX, so long I respected the design system in place.  

## Stack

The design was done in **Figma** and the code is written in **Typescript on React Native**.
