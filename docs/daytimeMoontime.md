# One man's short story

**1 oct 2019**

#### INSTANCE 1: existence/ just being
<img src="src/suntime.png"
     alt="suntime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man is seeing suntime, therefore experiencing suntime.</br>
Man cannot experience moontime, because he is asleep when it’s there.</br>

Hence, Man is only aware of the existence of suntime, not moontime. 
</br>
</br>
</br>
#### INSTANCE 2: awareness
<img src="src/moontime.png"
     alt="moontime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />

Man is awake at night, so he sees moontime, therefore experiencing and knowing its existence.</br>
Man can experience one of them at a time. Man only has its present moment, not memory of the past at all.</br>
Man is still aware of only one of the two sides. Not both at the same time. </br>

Hence Man is aware of the time which is in front of him. 
</br>
</br>
</br>
#### INSTANCE 3: neurons
<img src="src/suntime.png"
     alt="suntime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man is now able to keep one instance back in his memory.</br>
The instance of this memory keeps changing, as it keeps changing from suntime to moontime and like this an infinite loop. </br>
Man can only keep two things in his head, the present, say suntime, and the previous instance, moontime. </br>
Man knows that previous instance is moontime because it was in his memory, not because things can only be this two ways.</br>
Man knows about 2 types of times, but doesn’t know what else to do with it so it is meaningless.

Hence Man is aware of suntime and moontime existence, but unaware of correlation. 
</br>
</br>
</br>
#### INSTANCE 4: synapsis
<img src="src/moontime.png"
     alt="moontime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man suddenly, after a long time just being captivated by observing moontime and suntime consecutively, realises a whole different thing, a sparkle.</br>
Man starts having sparkles more and more often and more intense.</br>
Man suddenly is aware of this sparkles, he knows that it will come again after one just happened.</br>
Man keeps being mesmerised by the nature of both sides.</br>
Man knows 3 things now: suntime, moontime and sparkles.</br>

Hence Man is very curious now. He experiences change.
</br>
</br>
</br>
 #### INSTANCE 5: rhythmic action potentials 
<img src="src/suntime.png"
     alt="suntime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man notices a pattern: “suntime, always comes after a sparkle, and moontime...too”.</br>
Man discovers the rhythm; “suntime, sparkle, moontime”. Again “ “suntime, sparkle, moontime and then sparkle, and suntime, and sparkle and moontime....”.</br>
Man is unaware of other possibilities, only this exact pattern.</br>
Man is entertained, as usual. </br>
“Sparkle, suntime, sparkle, moontime, sparkle, suntime…”.</br>

Hence Man is super excited now, starts to want to know more!
</br>
</br>
</br>
#### INSTANCE 5: neural network
<img src="src/moontime.png"
     alt="moontime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man gets tired and sleepy at suntime for the first time, he falls asleep. </br>
Man wakes up accidently in moontime, and can’t go to sleep again. </br>
Man feels weird, “I am awake and it should be suntime”. </br>
Man has the idea, the belief, that suntime should be there. </br>
Man’s mind, together with the memory of the past experiences and learnings, are finally useful! Man knows!
</br>
</br>
</br>
#### INSTANCE 6: craziness of life
<img src="src/suntime.png"
     alt="suntime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man gets better, things get back to normal, suntime, spark, and then, after suntime always comes moontime.</br>
Man feels happy about knowing this, knowing the future.</br>
Man is proud of feeling smart.</br>
Man challenges himself to predict the future a few steps ahead: he designs the paper and a while after, the calculator.</br>
Man starts writing down the sequence and then making sure to test them out and keep feeding his ego by proving himself he is right. </br>
Man designs an algorithm that will predict the future without his help. Man automates the system. </br>
Man is now free from needing to know about the future and constantly calculating the next few steps, as his fancy tech, the AI will let him know. </br>
Man is bored, man feels useless, man is not proud of himself. Man is depressed and hopeless.</br>
Man cries dry tears.</br>
Man feels like dying is better. </br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
#### INSTANCE 7: mindfulness 
<img src="src/moontime.png"
     alt="moontime"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 20%; border-radius: 50%;" />
Man looks around and finds no one, nothing, just him and suntime and moontime again.</br>
Man gets distracted by the familiarity of suntime and moontime. Forgets that he is sad. </br>
Man remembers that he had a previous job or just something to do which was not crying and building algorithms.</br>
Man goes back to his initial position and breathe in and out deeply, and just becomes the Man staring at suntime and moontime again.</br>
Man is aware that this is and will always be his innate way of being. </br>
Man knows about roller coasters and the law of impermanence, of equanimity. 

Man is alive, he exists, he knows, he accepts.
