## What does this do?

Creative tool to encourage you to practice your artistic skills consistently.

3 words each day that allows you to sketch quickly and share it to the community.

Ability to upload and view other‚Äôs representations.

## Concept context

I had the need for a daily drawing exercise so I decided to build an app to get myself and friends to join the fun ensemble + to keep testing and improving my coding and design skills.

What I learned so far is how to use Firebase tools:

- how to CRUD on Firestore database
- use Cloud Storage
- test and deploy the app production ready

There‚Äôs still a lot to do before publishing the app (authentication feature and rules, fix some üêû...) but feel free to play around and please let me know if you have any feedback!

## Design process

I was aiming for a modern, playful and out-of-the-box feel. Close to breaking the design principles but not quite.  
I focused mainly on the mobile screen and readjusted the web view from there.

## Up next

I got feedback from some cool humans and the list is long!
In a nutshell:

- fix image loading delay
- fix inaccessible button
- image carousel?
- upload complete feedback
- web layout ugly
- figure out how to attract the first 4-10 users. Why would they want to use this and keep coming back?
- make it private to avoid spamming (ie users are given an access code)
- think about maybe setting specific days for releasing new words instead of providing every day
    - have a telegram group or newsletter to notify users that next words are coming x date

## Stack

- **NextJS and React** framework
- **Typescript** language
- **TailwindCSS** for UI
- **Firebase/Firestore** for database and hosting
