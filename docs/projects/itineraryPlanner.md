## What does this do?

- Display a list of containers currently in the bike stock
- Display a list of stores, showing:
    - if a store has already been visited
    - the store's containers stock
- feature allow transferring containers between bike stock and store stock
- Select one or multiple containers to transfer

## Context

This was Vytal's entry code challenge for a frontend position.  
The design was not the most relevant but I still had fun making it look pretty and usable.

## Tech stack
