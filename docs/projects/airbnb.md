_Sep 2019_

![airbnb-screenshot](../projects/assets/airbnb.png)

Link to the my [Airbnb replica website](https://airbnb-ly.herokuapp.com/) to play around. The code is on github, divided into [front-end](https://github.com/lydialawli/airbnb-react/) and the[ api](https://github.com/lydialawli/airbnb-api).

## Context

I attended a 2 month long **Fullstack Web App development Bootcamp** in Sep 2019 in Thailand, beginner friendly.
During the course, there were constantly new technologies and tools introduced to us. In order to apply all this tools in a real scenario we built the replica of the Airbnb platform. Each of us worked on our own version.

The goal of this project was to learn how to **build from scratch** the **front-end** and the **back-end**, how to connect both ends together, practice and improve our Javascript level, and also to learm how to use external api's and frameworks.
