## What does this do?

In a nutshell: a comprehensive platform for managing international e-commerce vouchers with easy accessibility to view, create, modify, and replicate vouchers.

## Explanation

The Vouchers platform is aimed at streamlining international e-commerce voucher management by providing a centralized location to manage all voucher-related activities. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows users to quickly access voucher templates, generate new vouchers, modify existing vouchers or replicate them to create new ones with minimum effort.

The platform includes all necessary tools to enhance voucher management, such as advanced search, filters and bulk actions functionality. It allows users to easily find and retrieve vouchers with specific attributes, such as category/project, voucher name and voucher code.

Moreover, the platform provides advanced analytics to track each voucher performance, such as overview information, usage rate, redemption rate, and revenue generated. With this data, users can make informed decisions about voucher strategies, such as making changes to the voucher design or extending the validity period.

Overall, this platform offers an all-in-one solution for managing international e-commerce vouchers, enabling businesses to enhance customer engagement, boost sales, and improve customer loyalty.

## Where can I see this live?

As this is an internal tool, it is currently restricted for use only within the organization and is not available for public access.

## Context

As a part of my job, I was given the responsibility of creating and programming a brand new web application with the aim of streamlining the workflow of other departments, particularly Customer Service. Even though most of the necessary features had already been in existence for several years, they were a part of a monolithic application with an outdated design. Therefore, the primary objective was to extract all the ordering features and implement them in a new web app with enhanced functionalities while maintaining the same backend.

## Design phase

After several meetings with the business owner to discuss project requirements, I kicked off the design process with preliminary wireframes on paper. As the project progressed, I shifted to Figma, where I performed all remaining design work, prototyping, and refinement. Throughout each stage, I actively involved the developers and business owner to ensure we remained aligned and on track.

To ensure consistency with the development library, Material UI, I referred frequently to relevant documents while building components in Figma. While following Google's design principles, I remained flexible and incorporated creative elements that satisfied project needs.

## Stack

The designs (the ones you can see up here) are made in **Figma**.

The frontend code was built in:

- React
- MaterialUI
- Typescript
- GraphQL
