## Definition

Creative tool to encourage you to practice your artistic skills consistently.

3 words each day that allows you to sketch quickly and share it to the community.

Ability to upload and view other‚Äôs representations.

## Context

I had the need for a daily drawing exercise so I decided to build an app to get myself and friends to join the fun ensemble + to keep testing and improving my coding and design skills.

What I learned so far is how to use Firebase tools:

- how to CRUD on Firestore database
- use Cloud Storage
- test and deploy the app production ready

There‚Äôs still a lot to do before publishing the app (authentication feature and rules, fix some üêû...) but feel free to play around and please let me know if you have any feedback!

## Stack

- **NextJS and React** framework
- **Typescript** language
- **TailwindCSS** for UI
- **Firebase/Firestore** for database and hosting
